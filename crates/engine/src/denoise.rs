//! AI denoise, the session's side (`docs/denoise.md`): which photos have a denoised picture, making the missing ones
//! in the background, and keeping the cache within its size.
//!
//! The denoised picture of a raw photo is *cached data*, never a file in the library: it is made from the untouched
//! original by the model the user chose, kept in `<library>/denoise/<key>.lcdn`, and thrown away whenever space is
//! needed (it is made again when it is next wanted). Its name is a hash of the model, the algorithm and the photo's
//! content, so a changed file or another model simply does not find it. The Denoise *amount* is an ordinary develop
//! setting (`enhance.denoise`): a render mixes the plain and the denoised picture by it ([`crate::media`]).
//!
//! What runs where: the session thread only decides (which photos, which model) and keeps an index of what is ready
//! ([`crate::media::DenoiseIndex`], memory only). One background thread at a time decodes a photo, runs the model on
//! its mosaic tile by tile and writes the product ([`make_product`]); an export that finds its photo's product missing
//! makes it itself, on its own thread, so it never comes out without the denoise it was asked for.
//!
//! Failure is a message, never a panic: a file that is not a Bayer raw, a model that does not load, a full disk, a
//! panic inside the runtime and a cancelled job all end as an [`Outcome`] the pump records.
